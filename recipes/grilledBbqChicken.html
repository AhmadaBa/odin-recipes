<p>Along with hot dogs and hamburgers, barbecued chicken is about as classic as it gets when it comes time for grilling. But chicken takes longer to cook than either hot dogs or hamburgers and loves lower cooking temperatures, so it's easy to mess up by under-cooking, over-charring, or both. The trick to good BBQ Chicken?

<em> Patience.</em> </p>

<p>Done right, it will take at least an hour, and even up to 2 hours. Remember that barbecue is slow and low, grilling is hot and fast. You can grill a chicken breast, but chicken thighs, legs, or wings are far better barbecued.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts (legs, thighs, wings, breasts)</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 cup barbecue sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Coat the chicken pieces with olive oil and sprinkle salt over them on all sides</li>
    <li>Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. If you are using charcoal or wood, make sure there is a cool side to the grill where there are few to no coals.</li>
    <li>Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill uncovered for 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how hot the grill is (you do not want the chicken to burn)
        Once you have a good sear on one side, turn the chicken pieces over and move them to the cooler side of the grill.
        If you are using a gas grill, maintain the flame on only one side of the grill, and move the chicken pieces to the cooler side, not directly over the flame. Reduce the temp to low or medium low (between 250F and 275F, no more than 300F).
        Cover the grill and cook undisturbed for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>

    <li>Turn the chicken pieces over and baste them with with your favorite barbecue sauce. Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15 to 20 minutes.Repeat, turning the chicken pieces over, basting them with sauce, covering, and cooking for another 10-30 minutes.
        The timing will depend on your grill set-up, the size of your chicken pieces, and how cold your chicken pieces are to start with! If you're grilling smaller pieces of chicken on a charcoal grill, they may be done much earlier. The goal is to maintain a low enough grill temp so that the chicken cooks "low and slow."
        The chicken is done when the internal temperature of the chicken pieces are 160F for breasts and 170F for thighs, when tested with a meat thermometer.
        Or if you insert the tip of a knife into the middle of the thickest piece and the juices run clear, the chicken is done. If the chicken isn't done, turn the pieces over and continue to cook at a low temperature.
        </li>
    <li>If you want, you can finish with a sear on the hot side of the grill. To do this, put the pieces, skin side down, on the hot side of the grill. Allow them to sear and blacken slightly for a minute or two.</li>
