<p> A close relative to Greek gyros and Turkish doner kebab, shawarma is the ultimate Middle-Eastern version of street food popular both across Lebanon, as well as in other Arabic countries and across the world. Although it may seem simple at first glance, it actually takes up to 2 days to prepare the original Lebanese shawarma. The first step is to mix up a marinade from garlic, olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice and a whole array of spices - usually a special shawarma mix known as The 7 spices which consists of coriander, black pepper, cinnamon, turmeric, cloves, and nutmeg, to name just some.</p>
<p>Finally, shawarma can be served in two ways - on a plate, with a side of rice, vegetables and flat bread, or tucked into a pita bread with onions, tomatoes, parsley, pickled vegetables, sometimes even with French fries</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) beef or mutton</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, mashed</li>
    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (80 ml) vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tbsp shawarma seasoning blend</li>
    <li>1 tbsp dry coriander, ground</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
    <li> 1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    <li>1 tbsp salt, adjust to taste</li>
    <li>1 medium-sized tomato, sliced or diced</li>
    <li>1/2 green pepper, cut into strips</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>4 tbsp sumac</li>
    <li>1 cup (30g) chopped parsley</li>
    <li>pickles, sliced</li>
    <li> pita bread</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cut the meat into long, thin strips. Prepare the marinade by mixing garlic, oil, vinegar, shawarma seasoning blend, coriander, black pepper, turmeric, cinnamon, and salt. Rub the marinade into the meat, cover, and refrigerate overnight or at least for several hours.</li>
    <li>Cook the meat in a pan over strong flame until the marinade evaporates. Then, pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of water and continue cooking until the meat is soft. Add tomato and pepper slices and stir until they fall apart. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Spread the sauce over the pita bread. Top with sliced onion, pickles, sumac and parsley, and finish with shawarma. Roll and serve.</li>
